    <h1>The best nature templates</h1>
    <p> A landing page is a standalone web page that potential customers can “land” on when they click through from an email,
         ad, or other digital location. A landing page aims to capture information from contacts in exchange for something of value, such as a retail offer code or business-to-business (B2B) insights in the form of a white paper. Landing pages are different from other web pages in that they don’t live in the evergreen navigation of a website. They serve a specific purpose in a specific moment of an advertising campaign to a target audience.
        Landing pages are ideal for digital ad campaigns,
         but they can also be useful tools when you connect a QR code on print marketing materials to a specific page. The goal of a landing page is to convert visitors, so it’s an essential tool to have at your disposal for all types of marketing campaigns.
